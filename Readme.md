# Build smart contract

This educational process laid a thorough groundwork in Ethereum smart contract development, deployment, and interaction. Practical tasks and GitHub updates allowed me to gain practical experience and compile a demonstrative portfolio. I acquired skills in creating ERC20 tokens, handling hashed messages on the blockchain, and automating smart contract interactions with ethers.js. Additionally, I explored zkSync and paymasters for transaction fee handling and token balance oversight.
